### Getting Started

Make sure you have Node.js Stable version or newer.

```bash
npm i @pureeval/serein gulp-cli -g

serein # get help
```

#### Tips
Due to potential performance issues with the `npm` package manager while the installation of some dependencies (such as long-time installation), Serein will prioritize using the `pnpm` package manager if it was installed in your environment.

You can also install the `pnpm` tool using the following method, which is a superior package manager compared to `npm`!

```bash
npm i pnpm -g

pnpm --version
```

### Create A Template Project

Use `serein i` or `serein init` in an empty directory to create a template project interactively.

Use `-y` or `--yes` flag to create the project without asking any questions.

> Notice: On the Android platform, `npm` may not work properly, so ignore the errors it throws.

### Building Project

Use `serein b` or `serein build` to build the current project.

Executing build in the project directory will automatically build the Minecraft Resource Package structure in the `build` directory (but not package it to `.mcpack`).

### Packaging Project

Use `serein p` or `serein pack` to build and package the current project.

Executing pack in the project directory will automatically build the Minecraft Resource Package structure in the `build` directory and package it to `.mcpack`.

### Deploying Project

Use `serein d` or `serein deploy` to deploy the current project to the Minecraft: Bedrock Edition resource directory.

- On Windows platforms, the Minecraft Bedrock Edition directory is automatically found and the current project is deployed.

- On Linux platforms, automatic deployment using the `mcpelauncher` launcher is supported, if you use another launcher, use another platform deployment solution instead.

- On other platforms, please change the `mc_dir` in `.serein.json` to your Minecraft: Bedrock Edition directory.

### Hot Reload

Use `serein w` or `serein watch` to deploy a project and enable hot reloading for it.

Serein will watch the `behavior_packs` and `resource_packs` directories and if any of the files in them change, the project will be rebuilt and automatically deployed to Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.

### Change of Dependency Version

The current Script API iterates very quickly and out-of-date versions of developer resources and games can be disruptive as a result.

Use `serein s` or `serein switch` to change the project manifest dependencies and npm module versions interactively.

Use the `-y` or `--yes` flag to update all dependencies directly to the latest version.

### Contributing to Serein

Serein still has many issues and features yet to be implemented, and the two main maintainers ([@Lampese](https://github.com/Lampese), [@CAIMEOX](https://github.com/CAIMEOX)) are still both high school students with very limited time.

If you have questions or suggestions for improvements, feel free to create an issue or send an email to me@lampese.com.

If you wish to contribute to the project, we welcome Pull Requests, even if it may be initially wrong.
